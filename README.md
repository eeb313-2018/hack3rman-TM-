# Introduction to the project
We are working with the Marine Predator Prey data set. We are investigating the difference in predator types and their success among niches, and how the predator/prey distributions and masses vary with temperature and depth. We will also be investigating if specialist predators are more successful than generalists.




# Description of the Data
The data set includes multiple variables, including predator body mass, niche, prey body mass, temperature, depth and specialist/generalist type. These are the most important variables for our project. These data variables will aid us in identifying any correlation for our project investigation. The data contains over 20 variables, with 34931 data points taken from 27 different aqautic locations. The data set comes from the study below.
